-- 3. Get all languages, even if there are no films in those languages – film title, description, and language name.
SELECT f.title, f.description, l.name
FROM language l
LEFT JOIN film f ON f.language_id = l.language_id;

CREATE TABLE new_film (
  id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
  name VARCHAR(100) NOT NULL
);

INSERT INTO new_film (name) VALUES 
('Inception'),
('The Matrix');

CREATE TABLE customer_review (
  review_id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
  film_id INT REFERENCES new_film(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
  language_id INT REFERENCES language(language_id),
  title VARCHAR(100),
  score INT CHECK (score BETWEEN 1 AND 10),
  review_text TEXT,
